    "Seeing is called by turbulence. The atmosphere can be imagined to be a boiling liquid. The best sites in the world have seeing limited to 0.5 arcseconds. Lucky imaging (lots of samples to capture the brief moments where seeing is good). Turbulence is defined by the Fried parameter, and the larger the aperture, the  more independent turbulence we have. This creates lots of speckles. AO has much better technology in the military, and astronomers are very behind. We can use a Na D laser to make a closed loop so we can characterize the atmosphere.

    "More lenient with earlier reports. The quantitative uncertainty must be justified for each measurement (e.g. systematic error from the instrument or statistical or both). Every time you show a component you should give both the component number and the relevant distances. The data analysis section should be very mathematically detailed, and so the equation should be as well. The part numbers can be identified if it's special but one sentence saying \"I used TR3 posts\" is good. The photos are supplementary, you should hand draw images. You still need to incorporate the information from a sketch, including distances and distance references. Your work should be replicable. Record changes, and if the same drawing gets messy, and describe the final set up in detail. \n",
