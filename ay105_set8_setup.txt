remember the procedure is (science - dark) / (flat - bias)

bias (slide 65)
An exposure of zero duration with the shutter closed. Removes the DC bias introduced to account for variation in read noise.

flat (slide 66)
A long exposure to measure the variations in pixel to pixel sensitivity. Typically the twilight sky or the inside of the dome.

dark (slide 67)
Exposures with the same duration as the science frame.

watch a < 20 minute youtube video on docker
make a colab notebook that pulls the data from github and has a bash cell to handle the packages
make a virtual machine from the ubuntu I am using to do this assignment. 

How do I convert pixel value to flux? There does not appear to be any filtering of light from the star, so we can find 
the ratio of the brightness of the star to the brightness of the planet, and simply find a reference for the star's brightness. The star is 2MASSWJ 1207334-393254
