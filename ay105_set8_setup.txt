remember the procedure is (science - dark) / (flat - bias)

bias (slide 65)
An exposure of zero duration with the shutter closed. Removes the DC bias introduced to account for variation in read noise.

flat (slide 66)
A long exposure to measure the variations in pixel to pixel sensitivity. Typically the twilight sky or the inside of the dome.

dark (slide 67)
Exposures with the same duration as the science frame.
