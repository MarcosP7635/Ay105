,Part 2: Wavelength of Laser,,,,,
,Count of min (\pm sqrt) [LEFT],Count of min (\pm sqrt) [RIGHT],\Delta s \pm .5 um,"
+x towards wall on left when walking in,+y away from door, +z is the roof",,
,30,30,10.5,,after the first measurement we moved the screen in -y,
,34,34,10.5,,every delta s should be 10.5,
,35,35,11.5,,red laser!,in reality it is green
,50,51?,16.5,,error in counts is sqrt n because standard deviation,
,50,51?,17,,make sure phase shift is in the right units and that we are counting trough to trough,
,47,49,17,,jonah counted 49 for the right projection,
,80,80,22.5,,note: limited by the setup. the last measurement is the best one so far ,
trust the arcminutes!,,,,,counting fringes corresponds to change in path length!,
"start angle (degrees, arcmin if known)",Part III: Refractive Index,using thorlabs cr1 rotational stage,\pm 1 because human eyeballs and small tick marks,,lots of realigning. Jonah and Carlos have pictures of the rotational stage.,
,Count of min (\pm sqrt) [LEFT],Count of min (\pm sqrt) [RIGHT],top number (angle degrees),bottom number (arcminutes),plexiglass should be co-rotating ,
0,8,8,2,?,t is the thickness of the plexiglass,
-0.5,13,14-15,3,25,get the part number of the rotational stage,
"-0.5, -10",15,15,2,20,THROUGHOUT THIS SHEET WE ARE COUNTING THE NUMBER OF MINIMA,
"0, -10",17,17,3,35,,
"0, -5",16,16,3,30,,

Part IV,,,,,,
just write down your expectations. couldn't get a measurement. Need a collimator to better align as well as more time. ,,,,,,
